# PeanutPhysics
Peanut is a custom physics engine that I'm working on during my free time. I'm testing it using the Hazel engine, but it's not specifically designed for Hazel, and it will most likely never replace PhysX in Hazel. This is just a physics engine I'm developing in order to learn more about how physics engines work.
